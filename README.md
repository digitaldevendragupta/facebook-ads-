Struggling to get more customers into your cafe or restaurant?
As part of your social media strategy, you’re posting every day to boost your online presence. 👍🏽
That’s great! It’s an effective way to reach your audience, and many believe that organic reach alone is enough.
But if that’s the case, why do well-known brands still run ads even when they’re posting organically? 🤔
Did you know that ads can help you reach people nearby who might not even know your business exists?
With Facebook’s powerful targeting options, you can reach everyone in your area, including visitors. 😱
Facebook uses location data from users' phones to display your ads to people near your location who match your targeting criteria.
Just imagine how many potential customers you could reach. 👌🏽
When cafe and restaurant owners understand that ads can reach more people nearby, they can drive more foot traffic and turn it into paying customers.
Save this if you found it helpful. 💯
